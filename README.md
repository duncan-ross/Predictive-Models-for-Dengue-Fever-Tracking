## Abstract
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease which is common in tropical and subtropical areas
including Southeast Asia, Southern Asia, and Latin America. This virus has many symptoms including fever,
rash, aches and, in severe cases, life-threatening internal bleeding. Due to the severity of the virus, it is of interest
to model the virus spread to predict new cases. Prediction of cases on a regional basis allows countries and health
organizations to best allocate medical resources, especially in rural and underserved communities. The purpose of
this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of created machine learning models to predict new weekly cases in two
Latin American cities: Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. This project is part of an active data science
competition on the website drivendata.org. Due to the mosquito-mediated transmission of the virus, models were
trained based on data sets consisting of weather data such as rainfall, humidity, temperature, and vegetation
levels. The models used were negative-binomial GLM, deep neural network, and random forest ensemble. Each
was parameterized and tested, using the mean absolute error (MAE) as the scoring metric. Results and scoring
occurred via submission to the competition site, where the submissions were ranked based on the MAE over a
hidden test dataset.
